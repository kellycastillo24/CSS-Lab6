Nature is constructed/produced with architecture through multiple ways such as how there are trends for incorporating greenery onto buildings (either in their landscape or onto the walls of buildings themselves) which helps the environment. Other ways include that of using natural materials like wood or stone, creating open green spaces, or through design itself such as using materials that mimic nature, or by providing views of nature itself like the Katsura Imperial Villa.</div>
